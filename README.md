## Overview

This module provides APIs for building MCP (Model Context Protocol) clients and servers in Ballerina.

MCP is an open standard that enables seamless integration between Large Language Models (LLMs) and external data sources, tools, and services. It facilitates structured communication through JSON-RPC 2.0 over HTTP transport, allowing AI applications to access and interact with external capabilities in a standardized way.

The Ballerina MCP library implements both client and server-side functionality, supporting automatic tool discovery, type-safe schema generation, and streamable HTTP transport with Server-Sent Events (SSE) for bidirectional communication.
